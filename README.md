git init
git add [README.md](http://README.md) (But i didn’t mention it in my terminal cause I’m typing now )

git add . - adds all of the files on your project
git status - to check how the work is going and check where are you (in branches) 
git commit -m ‘First attempt’ - to name your first attempt (’First attempt’ refers to your name of commit it’s not necessary to call it as mine commit) 
git remote add origin AND (link of your repository “https://github.com/etc) 
git branch -M main (I don’t know why but it was necessary to mention)  
git push -u original main


Also i didn’t create gitignore file i still can’t figure out how it works
